Key aspects of the project include using Jquery to get a Json node, next / previous implementation and update implementation. The project also uses the bootstrap framework for a more professional and clean look. Due to time constaints, we were not able set the contact form to actually send an email. Developing the project was a steep learning curve, although we both thoroughly enjoyed working on it."
